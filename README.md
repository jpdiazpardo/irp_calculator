In Colombia the price of high cost drugs is regulated using International Reference Pricing (IRP). This process is cumbersome and sometimes badly done, due to the vast amount of peer countries and their respective sources of information. This project had the objective of retrieving all the relevant information from +20 structured & unstructured sources using a Python Web Crawler, in order to tackle this business problem in a more efficient manner. The algorithm improves the accuracy of the estimated value for IRP, mitigates price eroding & other regulatory risks, and allows competitive price intelligence for new drugs entering the Colombian market. 

**NOTE:** The sources are publicly available and included: NOMA, RAMQ, eMIT, NHS, FSS, DIMDI, CONSEJO NACIONAL DE PRECIOS DEL ECUADOR, COMPRAS PÃšBLICAS DEL ECUADOR, ANVISA, PETRONE, PBS, DIGEMID, INFARMED, NICE, PANAMA COMPRA, CHILE COMPRA, IMSS, ANMAT, AMELI and BPS.
